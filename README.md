# Personal Website

## Introduction
This will be my personal website that will present my professional projects and link to pages that I deem important. It will play the role of an online résumé.

Go to [mathusan.net](https://mathusan.net) to see it.


## Components
`index.php` is the main page

`count.php` is used to retrieve the number of times the page has been visited from the database and send to index.php  


## Big Changes

24/08/2020
I added an asynchronous counter to the page that counts the number of times the page has been visited and it updates that number without even reloading the page with AJAX calls.


## Conclusion
The designing of the page and the CSS were the hardest here, since CSS float, display and position properties are not very intuitive in my opinion, but I improved tremendously in these by building this.
